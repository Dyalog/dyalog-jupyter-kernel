## What are Jupyter notebooks?
A Jupyter notebook document combines an interactive coding session with narrative text according to [Donald Knuth's *literate programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm.

This is a nice format for teaching APL, explaining algorithms, and sharing ideas. The consumer of a notebook can experiment with the code, and make changes to the text and republish the notebook.

## What is the Dyalog Jupyter kernel?
Jupyter originated as a system for use with the **Julia**, **Python** and **R** programming languages (**JuPy**te**R**). To use the system with other programming languages, an interface between the Jupyter system and the language system (compiler, interpreter and what have you) is required. This interface is the language kernel.

## How do I use Jupyter notebooks?
Jupyter notebook documents can be used in the following ways:

- You can [install](./install.md) the Jupyter system locally on your machine to write and interactively use notebooks - this means that you can edit the text and execute the code examples within the notebooks.
- View the notebooks and execute the code [online](./online.md) in a dedicated sandboxed environment.
- View or share the notebook as a static document, for example using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
- Export notebooks to widely supported formats, such as HTML or PDF, in [local offline usage](./install.md) or in [Binder](./online.md#using-binder).  

	> Open the *File* menu, click on *Download as* and select format. Note that some target formats may require installation of third party tools.
